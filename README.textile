h2. Downloadify+Clip: Client Side File Creation and Clipboard Copy

*_Important! The swf has been compiled for online use only. Testing from the file path (i.e. file:// ) will not work as it will violate the security sandbox._*
^ I dunno about this, seems to be working just fine for me from local (Seedmanc).

h3. Overview

This library is a tiny JavaScript + Flash library that allows you to generate files on the fly, in the browser, without server interaction and copy an arbitrary string of text to clipboard upon saving. Web applications that allow you to generate vCards, color palettes, custom code, etc would benefit from using this library. In addition to increasing speed (no round trip to the server) this solution can reduce the database and server load of existing web applications. Note that in order to "force download" file from server you can make an XMLHTTPRequest with response type as blob, convert that blob to Base64 using FileReader and supply that as data source to Downloadify setting datatype to "base64".

h3. Demo

A "very simple demo is available":http://pixelgraphics.us/downloadify/test.html that lets you supply your own content and filename and test out saving, canceling, and the error functionality when the file is blank.
^ As this site does not belong to me it only has demo for file-saving functionality of Downloadify, no new copying version - Seedmanc.

For a real world usage, see "Starter for jQuery":http://starter.pixelgraphics.us . To quickly demo the usage, just click "Load Example Data" then click Download. After the initial page load, no further contact is made with the server. Everything happens on the client side.

h3. Download

Please download from the "Downloads":http://github.com/Seedmanc/Downloadify/downloads section of this project.

h3. Dependencies

_The end user must have Flash 10 or higher installed for this plugin to work. As of September 2009, it was at a 93% saturation, so most users should already have it installed._

Downloadify is only dependent on "SWFObject 2.0":http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/ which is included with the download. It is compatible with any JavaScript framework but has a helper for both jQuery and MooTools. Neither helper will be activated if Downloadify is inserted prior to including the framework library.

h3. Usage

*Any JavaScript framework*:

<pre>Downloadify.create( id_or_DOM_element, options );</pre>

*jQuery*:

<pre>$("#element").downloadify( options );</pre>
  
*MooTools:*

<pre>$("elementid").downloadify( options );</pre>

h3. Options

Unless you are using the jQuery plugin included with Downloadify, you must supply all required options with your call to the <tt>Downloadify.create</tt> function.

*Defaults and Required Options*

* <tt>swf</tt>: <tt>'media/downloadify.swf'</tt> <span style="color:red">*Required*</span> <br />_Path to the SWF File. Can be relative from the page, or an absolute path._
* <tt>downloadImage</tt>: <tt>'images/download.png'</tt> <span style="color:red">*Required*</span> <br />_Path to the Button Image. Can be relative from the page or an absolute path._
* <tt>width</tt>: 175 <span style="color:red">*Required*</span> <br />_Width of the button (and the flash movie)_
* <tt>height</tt>: 55 <span style="color:red">*Required*</span> <br />_Height of the button. This will be 1/4 the height of the image._
* <tt>filename</tt>: <span style="color:red">*Required*</span><br /> _Can be a String or a function callback. If a function, the return value of the function will be used as the filename._
* <tt>data</tt>: <span style="color:red">*Required*</span><br /> _Can be a normal String, base64 encoded String, or a function callback. If a function, the return value of the function will be used as the file data._
* <tt>dataType</tt>: <tt>'string'</tt><br /> _Must be a String with the value <tt>string</tt> or <tt>base64</tt>. Data paired with the <tt>dataType</tt> of <tt>base64</tt> will be decoded into a <tt>ByteArray</tt> prior to saving._
* <tt>transparent</tt>: false <br />_Set this to true to use wmode=transparent on the flash movie._
* <tt>append</tt>: false <br />_By default the contents of the targeted DOM element are removed. Set this to true to keep the contents and append the button._
* <tt>textcopy</tt>: '' <br />_String to be copied to clipboard upon saving._

*Event Callbacks*

No data is passed into these functions, they are simply called.

* <tt>onError</tt>: _Called when the Download button is clicked but your <tt>data</tt> callback returns <tt>""</tt>._
* <tt>onCancel</tt>: _Called when the Download button is clicked but the user then cancels without saving._
* <tt>onComplete</tt>: _Called when the Download button is clicked and the file is saved to the user's computer._

h3. Setting Up the Image

Downloadify supports (i.e. requires) three button states with limited support for a fourth. The states are:

* *Normal*
* *Over* ( When the mouse hovers over the button )
* *Down* ( When the button is pressed )
* *Disabled* ( Limited support, when .disable() is called on the Downloadify.Container object )

In trying to keep this plugin as simple as possible, all four states are always assumed to be present. You should prepare your button image as a single image the width you want your button, and four times the height of the button. All four states should then live in that one image in the same order as the previous list from top to bottom.

h3. Potential Issues

When working with different button images, you may find Flash has cached your image. This is the desired behavior on a live site, but not during development. To get around this, simply supply a ?rev=1 or ?rev=2 etc on the end of your downloadImage url.

h3. Compiling Notes

Current version was compiled using online IDE+SDK http://wonderfl.net. Note that it does not seem to be supporting separate files with code so you'll have to copy contents of base64.as to the main downloadify.as file and edit the sources appropriately to make it work there (put contents of downloadify.as into a package and put base64.as as a class outside the package with it's own "import flash.utils.ByteArray" inside).
